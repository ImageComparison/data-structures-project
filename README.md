## App
Initially John Howe ([@johnh-otu](https://github.com/orgs/ImageComparison/people/johnh-otu)) made a UI prototype for `UWP` (using WinUI 2). This directory was quickly abandoned for `UWP_APP` to separate the prototype from the current version. The `UWP_APP` folder was later renamed to `/App/UWP`.

The most up-to-date version of the final project.

### Building app

> To build the project I highly suggest following this tutorial to install all the tools required. [docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment?tabs=vs-2022-17-1-a%2Cvs-2022-17-1-b)

Open Visual Studio, go to the `/App/` folder, then click `/UWP_APP.sln` the project should be setup ready for you to go.
